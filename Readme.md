# How to create a float bar and different types of bar containers


<p>This example shows how to manually create different types of bar containers: 1) A bar container used to display bars at the top of the window, 2) A float bar container (it's created automatically when setting the Bar.DockInfo.ContainerType property to Floating), 3) A standalone bar container that can be freely positioned within the window.</p>
